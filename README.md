# PicTalk
PicTalk is an app that helps people who do not share the same language to communicate with each other. Using pictures/symbols connected to a multilingual dictionary, PicTalk is especially aimed at assisting refugees on their immediate entry to a new country. The first version of PicTalk was developed during the [http://hackforrefugees.com/](Hack for Refugees) in Gothenburg.
